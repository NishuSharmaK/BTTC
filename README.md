Best time to call engine


The best time to call a person is when the person called is likely to be most receptive to the call.
This engine will provide the "best time to call" for a given contact or RPC on a given time 
for the contacts.
Finding the best time to call is key to the success of a sales campaign. 
Using technology such as a predictive dialler significantly improves efficiency, but diallers cannot perform magic. 
if the target audience is not available to take your call at the time you make it then the basic contact objective 
will not be achieved.

The engine works on the demographic information and call attempts results from history for the person.
